Train multiple neural networks independently. After training, pick the one with the highest accuracy. Then, gradually update the weights of the other models to move toward the best one using a soft update rule. This helps the other models escape poor local minima and explore better nearby solutions. The process improves overall performance by encouraging convergence from different starting points toward a strong solution.
